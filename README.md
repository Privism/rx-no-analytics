# Introduction

Prevent tracking SDKs to run with Greenify prescription feature.

# Installation

1. Install [Greenify](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/oasis-feng/greenify/)
2. [Apply this rule](https://greenify.github.io/Privism/rx-no-analytics)

# Disclaimer

This prescription can't protect you from ALL tracking SDKs due to the limit of IFW, and I also don't have much time to download all SDKs to decompile and adding rules.

If you want to get better protection, you should use DNS or VPNs that support content blocking.
